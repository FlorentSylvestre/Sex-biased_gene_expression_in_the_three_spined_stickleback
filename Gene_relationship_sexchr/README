Script to describe gene orthology / paralogy between X and Y sex chromosome in the threespine stickleback


#SETUP
In 02_reference put:
1) The stickleback_chr.gff file (See STAR_aligment)
2) A complete reference genome INCLUDING the pseudoautosomal region this time
If your reference and Y come separately, do :
cat genome_F.fa Y.fa >genome.fa to concatenate them 
Make sure that all chromosome name between gff and reference genome match 

You also need the ninespine genome (ninespine_genome.fa) and gff (ninespine.gff)
Again, make sure the chromosome name match between the two files

Then you can run:
./01_script/01_extract_transcript_prot.sh 02_reference/stickleback_chr.gff 02_reference/genome.fa

./01_script/01_extract_transcript_prot.sh 02_reference/ninespine.gff 02_reference/ninespine_genome.fa


Then:
./01_script/run_02_run_Orthofinder

And finally:
01_script/03_parse_relationship.py 02_reference/stickleback_chr.gff "04_protein/Orthofinder/Results_Oct27"
/!!!!!!\ ADJUST Result_Oct27 to the date you ran it !!!!!!!!! check in 04_protein/ to know which one to use
