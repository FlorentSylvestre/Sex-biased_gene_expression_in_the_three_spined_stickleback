Pipeline used to clean, trim align and counts reads

Setup:
In 02_infos, you'll need:
A) a file with all correspondance between sample names and sex (can be created from the medatafile)
B) From that, you can create a file with all female sample names and another one with all male sample names

In 03_Ref√©rence you'll need:
1)The annotation in GFF format
2) A Female reference genome without the Y
3) A Male reference genome including the Y but without the first 0.34Mb (the pseudoautosomal region, already present of the X reference)
to exclude the pseudo autosomal region from the Y, you can use samtools faidx:
samtools faidx <path the the male reference> #This will first create an index for the file
samtools faidx <path to the male reference> ^^
