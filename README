Title: Sex-biased gene expression across tissues reveals unexpected differentiation in the gills of the threespine stickleback
Authors: Florent Sylvestre1, Nadia Aubin-Horth, Louis Bernatchez,
which is currently unpublished.

It consist of 4 main folders:

1) STAR_alignment contain all the script needed to reproduce alignement to the threespine stickleback reference genome and gene expression quantification for each tissue
2) Genome annotation contain all the script used to link each annotated genes in the threespined stickleback genome to an Uniprot entry, and extract gene function and ontology
3) Gene_relationship_sexchr contain all the script used to identify gene still sharing (or not) a copy between sex-chromosome of the threespine sticleback

4)Analyses makes use of results from all three precedent folder to reproduce analyses presented in the manuscript.

Finally, the Utils forlder contain some script usefull for converting data between format or removing pseudo-autosomal region from our reference


Usefull information:
All analyses are base of the V5 version of the threespine stickleback and its Y reference sequence.
it is available for download at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_016920845.1/
Used Annotation file and transcriptome are also available there.
